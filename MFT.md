# Image-Denoising-Using-Directional-Bases
In this project, multi-resolution Fourier Transform (MFT) is implemented. Specifically, none-overlapping windows are considered for the
MFT implementation. Also, three types of window are considered:
1. boxing window
2. Gaussian window
3. Laplacian of the gaussian window
